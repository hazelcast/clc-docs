= Advanced Scripting Guide

:description: This guide shows you how to write Advanced Scripts for CLC.

{description}

== Introduction

Hazelcast CLC provides scriptability using a Python-like language called Starlark.

The Advanced Scripts have the `.star` extension.
Throughout this guide, we refer to the advanced script as the script.

The code in a script is organized by top-level and optional functions.
The `main` function runs after all top-level statements have completed. For example, the following script prints lines for `Top-Level A`, `Top-Level C`, and `Main B` in that order.

[source,python]
----
print("Top-Level A")

def main():
    print("Main B")

print("Top-Level C")
----

Top-level code has the following constraints:

* Variables defined in the top-level become global immutable variables; they cannot be reassigned.
* Loops are not allowed.
* Conditional statements are not allowed.

These constraints do not exist in code written in functions.
The `main` function provides a convenient location for your code.

== Your First Script

Keeping these points in mind, let's write our first script.
This script prints the total number of entries across all maps.
Open your favorite code editor and optionally turn on the Starlark mode, if available, or the Python 3 mode.
Save the following code as `hello.star`:

[source,python]
----
def main():
    total_entries = 0
    for map_name in object_list("map"):
        total_entries += map_size(name=map_name)
    print("OK There are {} entries.".format(total_entries))
----

This code does the following:

* Iterates on the Map names in the cluster
* Retrieves the entry count for the corresponding Maps
* Sums the entry counts
* Displays the total number of entries

Before running the script, let's make sure we have a few Maps in the cluster.
Run the following commands in a terminal window to create populated Maps:

[source,bash]
----
clc demo map-setmany -n map1 10
clc demo map-setmany -n map2 20
clc demo map-setmany -n map3 30
----

You are ready to run the script:

[source,bash]
----
clc script run hello.star
----

The output is similar to:

----
OK There are 60 entries.
----

== Data Types

Advanced scripts support various data types.
Some of the data types are common to all Starlark scripts.
And others are CLC-specific.

Here is a summary of the Starlark-provided types:

[source,python]
----
just_none = None
a_boolean = True
an_integer = 38
a_float = 42.24
a_string = "Hazelcast"
a_list = [1, "two", 3.33, False]
a_tuple = (1, "two")
a_dictionary = {1: "one", "two": 2}
a_user_function = lambda: "some value"
a_builtin_function = len
----

For further information on these data types, refer to the link:https://github.com/google/starlark-go/blob/master/doc/spec.md#data-types[Starlark documentation^].

=== Data Value [[data_value]]

CLC introduces the `data` type, which contains the data object returned from distributed data structure (DDS) calls, such as `map_get`.
The data object is a serialized object that can be directly passed to another DDS call.
It's crucial to keep these object in their serialized form.
Otherwise they might be serialized in a way that cannot be deserialized by CLC, such as Java Serializable objects.
By keeping the objects in their original serialized form, CLC can use those objects as keys and values in an opaque way.

Currently, the only way to create data values is by reading one using a DDS call.
Here's some code that does that, save it as `data_value.star`

[source,python]
----
map_set("some-key", "some-value")
obj = map_get("some-key")
print(type(obj))
----

Running it:

[source,bash]
----
clc script run data_value.star
----

Outputs:
----
data
----

Once a data object is retrieved, you can check its type or deserialize it if its one of the supported data types.
You can use the following methods and functions with a data object:

* `X.type`: Returns the serialization identifier.
* `data_type(X)`: Returns the name of the serializer.
* `decode_data(X)`: Deserializes the value. Note that CLC cannot deserialize all values. An error will be raised in case the value was not deserialized.

These methods are summarized in the following script, which you can save  as `data_value2.star`:

[source,python]
----
map_set("some-key", "some-value")
obj = map_get("some-key")
print("String value of the data object     :", obj)
print("Numeric type of the enclosed object :", obj.type)
print("String value of the enclosed object :", data_type(obj))
print("The deserialized object             :", decode_data(obj))
----

Running it:

[source,bash]
----
clc script run data_value2.star
----

Outputs:
----
String value of the data object     : data(STRING)
Numeric type of the enclosed object : -11
String value of the enclosed object : STRING
The deserialzed object              : some-value
----

== User Defined Functions

You can define regular functions using the `def` keyword and anonymous functions using the `lambda` keyword.

Here's an example function that calculates the square of the given number.
Save it as `fun.star`:

[source,python]
----
def sqr(a):
    return a * a

print(sqr(5))
----

Running the script outputs:
----
25
----

For further information on functions, refer to the link:https://github.com/google/starlark-go/blob/master/doc/spec.md#function-definitions[Starlark documentation^].

Anonymous functions are useful to define trivial, inline functions.
The following example iterates a list of numbers and creates a new list by calling a function with each item.
Save the script as `anonymous.star`:

[source,python]
----
def main():
    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 5, 10]
    funs = [
        ("identity", lambda x: x),
        ("squared", lambda x: x * x),
        ("10 more", lambda x: x + 10),
    ]
    for label, f in funs:
        new_list = [f(x) for x in my_list]
        print(label, new_list)
----

Running the script outputs:
----
identity [1, 2, 3, 5, 10]
squared [1, 4, 9, 25, 100]
10 more [11, 12, 13, 15, 20]
----

For further information on anonymous functions, refer to the link:https://github.com/google/starlark-go/blob/master/doc/spec.md#lambda-expressions[Starlark documentation^].

== Builtin Functions

=== Map Functions

You can use several Map functions in your advanced scripts.
See the link:clc-script.adoc[script] command documentation for the list of the functions available to advance scripts.
In this section, you are going to use some of those functions.

The `map_set` function sets a value for a key in a Map.
The key may be any Starlark value or it can be encoded data.
The `map_get` function returns the encoded data for the given key.
Save the following script as `map1.star`.
[source,python]
----
def main():
    map_name = "num-map"
    for i in range(3):
        map_set(i, "value-{}".format(i), name=map_name)
    print("Map size:", map_size(name=map_name))
    for i in range(3):
        value = map_get(i, name=map_name)
        decoded_value = decode_data(value)
        print("Value:", decoded_value)
----
Running this script outputs:
----
Map size: 3
Value: value-0
Value: value-1
Value: value-2
----

Note the `value = map_get(i, name=map_name)` line.
The `map_get` function returns the encoded data, not the actual value you passed to `map_set`.
This behavior differs from official Hazelcast client libraries, which decode the data and return the decoded value.
The reason for this behavior is covered in the <<data_value>> section.

`map_key_set` returns the list of keys for a member. To make the above example more robust by getting the keys from the cluster instead of manually specifying them.
Save the following script as `map2.star`:
[source, python]
-----
def main():
    map_name = "num-map"
    for i in range(3):
        map_set(i, "value-{}".format(i), name=map_name)
    print("Map size:", map_size(name=map_name))
    for key in map_key_set(name=map_name):
        value = map_get(key, name=map_name)
        decoded_value = decode_data(value)
        print("Value:", decoded_value)
-----

You can also use the `map_entry_set` function to list `(key, value)` pairs in a map.
Let's modify the script above to use that function.
Save the following script as `map3.star`:
[source, python]
-----
def main():
    map_name = "num-map"
    for i in range(3):
        map_set(i, "value-{}".format(i), name=map_name)
    print("Map size:", map_size(name=map_name))
    for key, value in map_entry_set(name=map_name):
        decoded_value = decode_data(value)
        print("Value:", decoded_value)
-----

=== Utilities

CLC provides the functions below that may be useful in many kinds of scripts.

==== argv

The `argv` function returns the arguments passed to the script in a list.
The first item (index 0) is the script's name.

Save the following script as `args.star`:

[source,python]
----
def main():
    args = argv()
    print("Script     :", args[0])
    for i, arg in enumerate(args[1:]):
        print("Argument", i + 1, ":", arg)
----

1. Let's run it with no arguments:
+
[source,bash]
----
clc script run args.star
----
+
Output:
+
----
Script     : args.star
----
+
2. Let's run it with 3 arguments:
+
[source,bash]
----
clc script run args.star -- foo bar quux
----
+
Output:
+
----
Script     : args.star
Argument 1 : foo
Argument 2 : bar
Argument 3 : quux
----
+
3. Now let's try passing a flag to our script.
Remember that flags have a dash (`-`) as a prefix:
+
[source,bash]
----
clc script run args.star -- foo --my-flag
----
+
Output:
+
----
Script     : args.star
Argument 1 : foo
Argument 2 : --my-flag
----

The `--` is required after the script path because the flags for the script command can appear anywhere in the command line, even at the end.
You must use `--` before any flag that must be passed to the script itself to help the argument parser.
If no flags are passed to the script, you can omit the double dash, but its use reduces errors.

==== env

You can access the environment variables using the `env` command.
When run without arguments, it returns the list of (name, value) pairs.
Save the following script as `env1.star`.

[source,python]
----
def main():
    for name, value in env():
        print(name, "=", value)
----

Running the script outputs all environment variables.
----
DESKTOP_SESSION = plasma
DISPLAY = :0
EDITOR = /usr/bin/vim
GDK_BACKEND = x11
----

You can also get the value of a single environment variable, by passing its name to `env`.
Here's an example:
[source, python]
----
user_home = env("HOME")
print("My home directory:", user_home)
----

==== now

`now()` function returns the current local time in nanoseconds.

You can convert the time to other units using the predefined time units, such as `MILLISECOND`, `SECOND` and `DAY`.
For the valid values, see the xref:clc-script.adoc[clc script run] topic.
The following example measures the duration of an object_list operation, and prints the result in various time units.

[python,source]
----
time = now()
print(time)
----

You can convert the time from nanoseconds to other time units using the provided built-in values.
Here's an example that shows how to convert nanoseconds to other time units.
Save the following script as `time.star`:

[source,python]
----
tic = now()
object_list()
toc = now()
took = toc - tic

print("The operation took:")
print("  ", took//NANOSECOND, "nanoseconds")
print("  ", took//MICROSECOND, "microseconds")
print("  ", took//MILLISECOND, "milliseconds")
print("  ", took//SECOND, "seconds")
----

Running it outputs:
----
The operation took:
   4152911 nanoseconds
   4152 microseconds
   4 milliseconds
   0 seconds
----

==== sleep

It is sometimes necessary to wait for a specified period before continuing.
`sleep` command waits for the given time in nanoseconds.
You can also specify other time units, such as milliseconds and seconds, as described in the xref:clc-script.adoc[clc script run] topic.
Here's a script that just waits for two seconds.

[source,python]
----
print("Falling asleep...")
sleep(2*SECOND)
print("Woke up")
----

=== Logging

CLC provides several logging functions, which log messages using CLC's logging mechanism.

* `log_error(STRING_OR_ERROR)`: Logs a message or an error with the ERROR level.
* `log_warn(STRING)`: Logs a message with the WARN level.
* `log_info(STRING)`: Logs a message with the INFO level.
* `log_debug(STRING)`: Logs a message with the DEBUG level.

If the logging level set with `--log.level` is higher than the log level of a message, that message is not written to the log.
For example, if `--log.level error` specified then only `log_error` functions log messages.

The `--log.path PATH` flag can be used to redirect the log messages to the given file or to STDERR (usually the terminal) if `stderr` is used.

Here is a sample script to try the interplay of the log messages and logging levels.
Save it as `logging.star`.

[source,python]
----
log_error("This is an error log")
log_warn("This is is a warn log")
log_info("This is an info log")
log_debug("This is a debug log")
----

First, run it as follows.
Note that we set `--log.path stderr` to see the logs on the screen.
Otherwise they would written to the default log file.

[source, bash]
----
clc script run --log.path stderr --log.level error logging.star
----

As this specifies ERROR level log messages, the output is similar to the following:

----
2023-11-01T11:24:18+03:00  ERROR  [logging.star:2:10] This is an error log
----

Let's try once more with a different log level.
This time with DEBUG:

[source, bash]
----
clc script run --log.path stderr --log.level debug logging.star
----

This time all log messages are displayed and the output is similar to the following:

----
2023-11-01T21:30:13+03:00  ERROR  [logging.star:2:10] This is an error log
2023-11-01T21:30:13+03:00   WARN  [logging.star:3:9] This is is a warn log
2023-11-01T21:30:13+03:00   INFO  [logging.star:4:9] This is an info log
2023-11-01T21:30:13+03:00  DEBUG  [logging.star:5:10] This is a debug log
----

=== Debugging

Debug functions start with double underscores (`__`).
They run only when the debug mode is activated by passing the `--debug` flag to the `script` command.
They are ignored if the debug mode is not active.

==== __trace

You can use the `__trace` function to print the script name, line and column of the location whenever it is run.
You can also customize the trace message by passing a string to `__trace`.
Save the following script as `trace.star`.

[source,python]
----
def fun1():
    __trace()
    print("Fun 1")

__trace("Start-up")
fun1()
----

Running the script normally:
----
clc script run trace.star
----
Outputs:
----
Fun 1
----
That's because the `__trace` calls are removed.
Try again with the `--debug` flag:
----
clc script run --debug trace.star
----
Outputs:
----
>> Start-up: trace.star:5:8
>> TRACE: trace.star:2:12
Fun 1
----

== Output

Just like CLC commands, advanced scripts can produce both structured and unnecessary output.
The `print` function produces unnecessary output, which can be suppressed with the `--quiet` (shortcut `-q`) flag, and the `output` command produces structured output. The structured output is written out as a table, but you can change it to other formats using the `--format` (shortcut `-f`) flag.

Here's an example to demonstrate that.
Save the script as `output1.star`:
[source,python]
----
def main():
    fruits = ["apple", "grapes", "pear"]
    print("There are {} fruits.".format(len(fruits)))
    print("Unnecessary output lines will dissapear when you use -q\n")

    for i, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
        output(Index=i, Fruit=fruit)
----

Let's first run it normally:
[source,bash]
----
clc script run output1.star
----

Outputs:
----
There are 3 fruits.
Unnecessary output lines will dissapear when you use -q

----------------
 Index | Fruit
----------------
     0 | apple
     1 | grapes
     2 | pear
----------------
    OK Returned 3 row(s).
----

Let's now use the `-q` flag to suppress unnecessary output:
[source,bash]
----
clc script run output1.star -q
----

Outputs:
----
----------------
 Index | Fruit
----------------
     0 | apple
     1 | grapes
     2 | pear
----------------
----

As expected, unnecessary output was not produced.
Using a different output format also works:
[source,bash]
----
clc script run output1.star -q -f csv
----

Outputs:
----
Index,Fruit
0,apple
1,grapes
2,pear
----

Separating unnecessary and structured output makes it much easier to extract the result using a pipe.
This example uses the link:https://jqlang.github.io/jq/[jq] utility:
:
[source,bash]
----
clc script run output1.star -q -f json | jq '.Fruit'
----
Outputs:
----
"apple"
"grapes"
"pear"
----


Passing keyword arguments to `output` for column label and value can sometimes be limiting.
This is because only valid Starlark identifiers can be used as the column label.
For example, running the following script returns an error:
[source,python]
----
def main():
    output(1=2)
----
Because of that, CLC also supports passing a dictionary to the `output` function.
The dictionary must be passed as a positional argument and it must be the only argument to `output`.
The script can also be formatted as follows:
[source,python]
----
def main():
    output({1: 2})
----

The output function handles rows with missing values.
Here's a script to demonstrate that.
Save it as `output2.star`:
[source,python]
----
def main():
    for i in range(3):
        output({i: "OK"})
----
Running it outputs the following:
----
--------------
 0  | 1  | 2
--------------
 OK | -  | -
 -  | OK | -
 -  | -  | OK
--------------
----
Different output formats handle missing values differently.
JSON printer just skips the missing values:
[source,bash]
----
clc script run output2.star -f json
----
Outputs:
----
{"0":"OK"}
{"1":"OK"}
{"2":"OK"}
----

== Error Handling

Whenever an error occurs, CLC stops the script and prints an error message.
This is usually the safest way to handle the error.
But there are times when you want to try something that can result in an error, and handle it without giving back the control.

The `script run` command supports the `--ignore-errors` flag, which suppresses errors while running the script.
You can use the `last_error()` function to get the error so you can act on it.

Let's demonstrate that with an example using the `decode_data` function.
Passing a string to `decode_data` ends with an error; since that function expects an argument of type `data`.
Save the following sctipt as `error.star`:

[source,python]
----
def main():
    v = decode_data("foo")
    print(v)
----

And run it:

[source,bash]
----
clc script run error.star
----

This displays the following error:
----
 ERROR At error.star:2:19: expected argument 'value' to be data, got string
----

This time, run the script with the `--ignore-errors` flag:

[source,bash]
----
clc script run --ignore-errors error.star
----

The output is now similar to the following:
----
None
----

The error in the `data_value` line is ignored and `v` is set to `None`.

Let's now try to use the `last_error` function and act on errors.
Save the following script as `error2.star`:

[source,python]
----
def main():
    v = decode_data("foo")
    if last_error():
        v = "OK Caught the error."
    print(v)
----

Run the script with the `--ignore-errors` flag:
[source,bash]
----
clc script run --ignore-errors error2.star
----

This time the output is:

----
OK Caught the error.
----
Since you have used the `--ignore-errors` flag, the program didn't end with an error in the `decode_data` line but the error was recorded.
Using the `last_error` function, the existence of an error was checked and `v` was set to `OK Caught the error.`.

== Conclusion

Advanced Scripting is a powerful tool. It supports many use cases, which are not possible using standard CLC scripts

Be sure to check out the xref:clc-script.adoc[clc script run] command reference for all commands.
